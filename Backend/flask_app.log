In four sentences, capture the key insights, highlighting the most significant positive, negative, and neutral aspects of the product. Ensure the summary is accurate and reflects the overall sentiment of the reviews. Focus on the main points that would be most helpful for someone considering this product:\\nSuper compact, filled 4 automobile tires with charge left.  The pump fills quickly and the charge cord which attached to your vehicle has plenty of length.  Super happy!! This product comes in sharp packaging.  Has a nice bag the fits in the center console of my car for easy storage.  It charges quickly and can inflate all 4 of my cars tires ( from 36 psi to 42 psi in winter for my Tesla) on a single charge with room to spare.  I has already saved me many trips to the gas station tire pump in the free months I\\u2019ve owned it.  The battery recharges quickly.  You can also change the psi quickly and easily for bike tires and balls.  I\\u2019m thinking of getting a second one.  I\\u2019ve recommended the same to family and friends and they love it.  I highly recommend this product. I got this air pump and tried it out.I  was so impressed by it the instructions were easy to follow. I like that it came with these different things multiple uses.  I was so impressed I had to show off what it can do I lend to my friend and he was sold. Another friend asked me to bring it on vacation to fixed their tire because of how great this product is. The pressure gauge is accurateIt  also comes with a bag for carrying the unit which help to protect it from scratches and keepeverything together.  Overall, this isa good product and I like it.10  I recommend it. Easy to use.  Stops automatically at the pressure you set so it doesn\\u2019t need monitoring.  But the fully charged battery lasted less than 24 minutes.  In that time I was able to add 21 PSI to three tires.  If the battery lasted longer I would have given 5 stars.  It does come with a 10-foot 12V cord but I can\\u2019t reach all 4 tires with that length.  Overall, it\\u2019s a good product. I am so happy with this purchase! I had previously purchased a different portable air pump at a similar price point. My old pump was about 10 times the size, and did not have as many features. The compact size makes it ultra portable. I appreciate having the ability to select different modes so that the pump can be used safely on anything from sports equipment to vehicle tires. The handy built in flashlight is nice and bright, and the unit can be used as a power bank to recharge a cell phone in an emergency. My sister had a low tire on her vehicle when this arrived, so I had the opportunity to test out my new gadget right away, and it worked like a dream! I\'m looking forward to having this pump in the summer for pool toys and camping trips, and I plan to purchase a couple as gifts for upcoming birthdays. Unlike a hand pump, this requires zero effort to properly inflate bike tires, and the price was very reasonable. Seems to hold a charge for a long period of time, and seems to accurately inflate to the desired pressure. Really wonderful product! I mostly use this for my motorcycle and it\\u2019s pretty fast and small to put in my trunk, I will say it is a little slow pumping a car tire but that\\u2019s because they\\u2019re bigger tires meaning they need more airIt\\u2019s also accurate with the psi reading overall would buy again Nice little compressor.  Easy to program.  A better connector would be nice, since the one it has bleeds a lot of air pressure till you get the unit working.  But, the real problem is--it stops working at 33psi.  Tried to fill the front tire on my motorcycle to 36psi, but it gets to 33 and quits.  Tried it four (4) times and the same thing happened every time.  Aside from the air loss from the connector (probably can\'t expect a top-of-the-line one on a $40 unit) it wasn\'t badly designed unit.  I returned the unit I got, since as-is it\'s useless to me (tire pressure on motorcycles is a serious safety issue).  If the replacement unit works as advertised, I\'ll revise my rating accordingly.Update:I got the replacement unit in less than a week, long before I was notified that they received the defective unit.  I also got a locking tire chuck extension for $7 to try to compensate for the poor connector.  The new unit works like a charm.", "max_tokens": 150}' message='Post details'

In four sentences, capture the key insights, highlighting the most significant positive, negative, and neutral aspects of the product. Ensure the summary is accurate and reflects the overall sentiment of the reviews. Focus on the main points that would be most helpful for someone considering this product:\\nSuper compact, filled 4 automobile tires with charge left.  The pump fills quickly and the charge cord which attached to your vehicle has plenty of length.  Super happy!! This product comes in sharp packaging.  Has a nice bag the fits in the center console of my car for easy storage.  It charges quickly and can inflate all 4 of my cars tires ( from 36 psi to 42 psi in winter for my Tesla) on a single charge with room to spare.  I has already saved me many trips to the gas station tire pump in the free months I\\u2019ve owned it.  The battery recharges quickly.  You can also change the psi quickly and easily for bike tires and balls.  I\\u2019m thinking of getting a second one.  I\\u2019ve recommended the same to family and friends and they love it.  I highly recommend this product. I got this air pump and tried it out.I  was so impressed by it the instructions were easy to follow. I like that it came with these different things multiple uses.  I was so impressed I had to show off what it can do I lend to my friend and he was sold. Another friend asked me to bring it on vacation to fixed their tire because of how great this product is. The pressure gauge is accurateIt  also comes with a bag for carrying the unit which help to protect it from scratches and keepeverything together.  Overall, this isa good product and I like it.10  I recommend it. Easy to use.  Stops automatically at the pressure you set so it doesn\\u2019t need monitoring.  But the fully charged battery lasted less than 24 minutes.  In that time I was able to add 21 PSI to three tires.  If the battery lasted longer I would have given 5 stars.  It does come with a 10-foot 12V cord but I can\\u2019t reach all 4 tires with that length.  Overall, it\\u2019s a good product. I am so happy with this purchase! I had previously purchased a different portable air pump at a similar price point. My old pump was about 10 times the size, and did not have as many features. The compact size makes it ultra portable. I appreciate having the ability to select different modes so that the pump can be used safely on anything from sports equipment to vehicle tires. The handy built in flashlight is nice and bright, and the unit can be used as a power bank to recharge a cell phone in an emergency. My sister had a low tire on her vehicle when this arrived, so I had the opportunity to test out my new gadget right away, and it worked like a dream! I\'m looking forward to having this pump in the summer for pool toys and camping trips, and I plan to purchase a couple as gifts for upcoming birthdays. Unlike a hand pump, this requires zero effort to properly inflate bike tires, and the price was very reasonable. Seems to hold a charge for a long period of time, and seems to accurately inflate to the desired pressure. Really wonderful product! I mostly use this for my motorcycle and it\\u2019s pretty fast and small to put in my trunk, I will say it is a little slow pumping a car tire but that\\u2019s because they\\u2019re bigger tires meaning they need more airIt\\u2019s also accurate with the psi reading overall would buy again Nice little compressor.  Easy to program.  A better connector would be nice, since the one it has bleeds a lot of air pressure till you get the unit working.  But, the real problem is--it stops working at 33psi.  Tried to fill the front tire on my motorcycle to 36psi, but it gets to 33 and quits.  Tried it four (4) times and the same thing happened every time.  Aside from the air loss from the connector (probably can\'t expect a top-of-the-line one on a $40 unit) it wasn\'t badly designed unit.  I returned the unit I got, since as-is it\'s useless to me (tire pressure on motorcycles is a serious safety issue).  If the replacement unit works as advertised, I\'ll revise my rating accordingly.Update:I got the replacement unit in less than a week, long before I was notified that they received the defective unit.  I also got a locking tire chuck extension for $7 to try to compensate for the poor connector.  The new unit works like a charm.", "max_tokens": 150}' message='Post details'

In four sentences, capture the key insights, highlighting the most significant positive, negative, and neutral aspects of the product. Ensure the summary is accurate and reflects the overall sentiment of the reviews. Focus on the main points that would be most helpful for someone considering this product:\\nSuper compact, filled 4 automobile tires with charge left.  The pump fills quickly and the charge cord which attached to your vehicle has plenty of length.  Super happy!! This product comes in sharp packaging.  Has a nice bag the fits in the center console of my car for easy storage.  It charges quickly and can inflate all 4 of my cars tires ( from 36 psi to 42 psi in winter for my Tesla) on a single charge with room to spare.  I has already saved me many trips to the gas station tire pump in the free months I\\u2019ve owned it.  The battery recharges quickly.  You can also change the psi quickly and easily for bike tires and balls.  I\\u2019m thinking of getting a second one.  I\\u2019ve recommended the same to family and friends and they love it.  I highly recommend this product. I got this air pump and tried it out.I  was so impressed by it the instructions were easy to follow. I like that it came with these different things multiple uses.  I was so impressed I had to show off what it can do I lend to my friend and he was sold. Another friend asked me to bring it on vacation to fixed their tire because of how great this product is. The pressure gauge is accurateIt  also comes with a bag for carrying the unit which help to protect it from scratches and keepeverything together.  Overall, this isa good product and I like it.10  I recommend it. Easy to use.  Stops automatically at the pressure you set so it doesn\\u2019t need monitoring.  But the fully charged battery lasted less than 24 minutes.  In that time I was able to add 21 PSI to three tires.  If the battery lasted longer I would have given 5 stars.  It does come with a 10-foot 12V cord but I can\\u2019t reach all 4 tires with that length.  Overall, it\\u2019s a good product. I am so happy with this purchase! I had previously purchased a different portable air pump at a similar price point. My old pump was about 10 times the size, and did not have as many features. The compact size makes it ultra portable. I appreciate having the ability to select different modes so that the pump can be used safely on anything from sports equipment to vehicle tires. The handy built in flashlight is nice and bright, and the unit can be used as a power bank to recharge a cell phone in an emergency. My sister had a low tire on her vehicle when this arrived, so I had the opportunity to test out my new gadget right away, and it worked like a dream! I\'m looking forward to having this pump in the summer for pool toys and camping trips, and I plan to purchase a couple as gifts for upcoming birthdays. Unlike a hand pump, this requires zero effort to properly inflate bike tires, and the price was very reasonable. Seems to hold a charge for a long period of time, and seems to accurately inflate to the desired pressure. Really wonderful product! I mostly use this for my motorcycle and it\\u2019s pretty fast and small to put in my trunk, I will say it is a little slow pumping a car tire but that\\u2019s because they\\u2019re bigger tires meaning they need more airIt\\u2019s also accurate with the psi reading overall would buy again Nice little compressor.  Easy to program.  A better connector would be nice, since the one it has bleeds a lot of air pressure till you get the unit working.  But, the real problem is--it stops working at 33psi.  Tried to fill the front tire on my motorcycle to 36psi, but it gets to 33 and quits.  Tried it four (4) times and the same thing happened every time.  Aside from the air loss from the connector (probably can\'t expect a top-of-the-line one on a $40 unit) it wasn\'t badly designed unit.  I returned the unit I got, since as-is it\'s useless to me (tire pressure on motorcycles is a serious safety issue).  If the replacement unit works as advertised, I\'ll revise my rating accordingly.Update:I got the replacement unit in less than a week, long before I was notified that they received the defective unit.  I also got a locking tire chuck extension for $7 to try to compensate for the poor connector.  The new unit works like a charm.", "max_tokens": 150}' message='Post details'

The pump fills quickly and the charge cord which attached to your vehicle has plenty of length.  Super happy!! This product comes in sharp packaging.  Has a nice bag the fits in the center console of my car for easy storage.  It charges quickly and can inflate all 4 of my cars tires ( from 36 psi to 42 psi in winter for my Tesla) on a single charge with room to spare.  I has already saved me many trips to the gas station tire pump in the free months I\\u2019ve owned it.  The battery recharges quickly.  You can also change the psi quickly and easily for bike tires and balls.  I\\u2019m thinking of getting a second one.  I\\u2019ve recommended the same to family and friends and they love it.  I highly recommend this product. I got this air pump and tried it out.I  was so impressed by it the instructions were easy to follow. I like that it came with these different things multiple uses.  I was so impressed I had to show off what it can do I lend to my friend and he was sold. Another friend asked me to bring it on vacation to fixed their tire because of how great this product is. The pressure gauge is accurateIt  also comes with a bag for carrying the unit which help to protect it from scratches and keepeverything together.  Overall, this isa good product and I like it.10  I recommend it. Easy to use.  Stops automatically at the pressure you set so it doesn\\u2019t need monitoring.  But the fully charged battery lasted less than 24 minutes.  In that time I was able to add 21 PSI to three tires.  If the battery lasted longer I would have given 5 stars.  It does come with a 10-foot 12V cord but I can\\u2019t reach all 4 tires with that length.  Overall, it\\u2019s a good product. I am so happy with this purchase! I had previously purchased a different portable air pump at a similar price point. My old pump was about 10 times the size, and did not have as many features. The compact size makes it ultra portable. I appreciate having the ability to select different modes so that the pump can be used safely on anything from sports equipment to vehicle tires. The handy built in flashlight is nice and bright, and the unit can be used as a power bank to recharge a cell phone in an emergency. My sister had a low tire on her vehicle when this arrived, so I had the opportunity to test out my new gadget right away, and it worked like a dream! I\'m looking forward to having this pump in the summer for pool toys and camping trips, and I plan to purchase a couple as gifts for upcoming birthdays. Unlike a hand pump, this requires zero effort to properly inflate bike tires, and the price was very reasonable. Seems to hold a charge for a long period of time, and seems to accurately inflate to the desired pressure. Really wonderful product! I mostly use this for my motorcycle and it\\u2019s pretty fast and small to put in my trunk, I will say it is a little slow pumping a car tire but that\\u2019s because they\\u2019re bigger tires meaning they need more airIt\\u2019s also accurate with the psi reading overall would buy again Nice little compressor.  Easy to program.  A better connector would be nice, since the one it has bleeds a lot of air pressure till you get the unit working.  But, the real problem is--it stops working at 33psi.  Tried to fill the front tire on my motorcycle to 36psi, but it gets to 33 and quits.  Tried it four (4) times and the same thing happened every time.  Aside from the air loss from the connector (probably can\'t expect a top-of-the-line one on a $40 unit) it wasn\'t badly designed unit.  I returned the unit I got, since as-is it\'s useless to me (tire pressure on motorcycles is a serious safety issue).  If the replacement unit works as advertised, I\'ll revise my rating accordingly.Update:I got the replacement unit in less than a week, long before I was notified that they received the defective unit.

Focus on the main points that would be most helpful for someone considering this product:\\nSuper compact, filled 4 automobile tires with charge left.  The pump fills quickly and the charge cord which attached to your vehicle has plenty of length.  Super happy!! This product comes in sharp packaging.  Has a nice bag the fits in the center console of my car for easy storage.  It charges quickly and can inflate all 4 of my cars tires ( from 36 psi to 42 psi in winter for my Tesla) on a single charge with room to spare.  I has already saved me many trips to the gas station tire pump in the free months I\\u2019ve owned it.  The battery recharges quickly.  You can also change the psi quickly and easily for bike tires and balls.  I\\u2019m thinking of getting a second one.  I\\u2019ve recommended the same to family and friends and they love it.  I highly recommend this product. I got this air pump and tried it out.I  was so impressed by it the instructions were easy to follow. I like that it came with these different things multiple uses.  I was so impressed I had to show off what it can do I lend to my friend and he was sold. Another friend asked me to bring it on vacation to fixed their tire because of how great this product is. The pressure gauge is accurateIt  also comes with a bag for carrying the unit which help to protect it from scratches and keepeverything together.  Overall, this isa good product and I like it.10  I recommend it. Easy to use.  Stops automatically at the pressure you set so it doesn\\u2019t need monitoring.  But the fully charged battery lasted less than 24 minutes.  In that time I was able to add 21 PSI to three tires.  If the battery lasted longer I would have given 5 stars.  It does come with a 10-foot 12V cord but I can\\u2019t reach all 4 tires with that length.  Overall, it\\u2019s a good product. I am so happy with this purchase! I had previously purchased a different portable air pump at a similar price point. My old pump was about 10 times the size, and did not have as many features. The compact size makes it ultra portable. I appreciate having the ability to select different modes so that the pump can be used safely on anything from sports equipment to vehicle tires. The handy built in flashlight is nice and bright, and the unit can be used as a power bank to recharge a cell phone in an emergency. My sister had a low tire on her vehicle when this arrived, so I had the opportunity to test out my new gadget right away, and it worked like a dream! I\'m looking forward to having this pump in the summer for pool toys and camping trips, and I plan to purchase a couple as gifts for upcoming birthdays. Unlike a hand pump, this requires zero effort to properly inflate bike tires, and the price was very reasonable. Seems to hold a charge for a long period of time, and seems to accurately inflate to the desired pressure. Really wonderful product! I mostly use this for my motorcycle and it\\u2019s pretty fast and small to put in my trunk, I will say it is a little slow pumping a car tire but that\\u2019s because they\\u2019re bigger tires meaning they need more airIt\\u2019s also accurate with the psi reading overall would buy again Nice little compressor.  Easy to program.  A better connector would be nice, since the one it has bleeds a lot of air pressure till you get the unit working.  But, the real problem is--it stops working at 33psi.  Tried to fill the front tire on my motorcycle to 36psi, but it gets to 33 and quits.  Tried it four (4) times and the same thing happened every time.  Aside from the air loss from the connector (probably can\'t expect a top-of-the-line one on a $40 unit) it wasn\'t badly designed unit.  I returned the unit I got, since as-is it\'s useless to me (tire pressure on motorcycles is a serious safety issue).  If the replacement unit works as advertised, I\'ll revise my rating accordingly.Update:I got the replacement unit in less than a week, long before I was notified that they received the defective unit.  I also got a locking tire chuck extension for $7 to try to compensate for the poor connector.  The new unit works like a charm.", "max_tokens": 150}' message='Post details'

Ensure the summary is accurate and reflects the overall sentiment of the reviews. Focus on the main points that would be most helpful for someone considering this product:\\nSuper compact, filled 4 automobile tires with charge left.  The pump fills quickly and the charge cord which attached to your vehicle has plenty of length.  Super happy!! This product comes in sharp packaging.  Has a nice bag the fits in the center console of my car for easy storage.  It charges quickly and can inflate all 4 of my cars tires ( from 36 psi to 42 psi in winter for my Tesla) on a single charge with room to spare.  I has already saved me many trips to the gas station tire pump in the free months I\\u2019ve owned it.  The battery recharges quickly.  You can also change the psi quickly and easily for bike tires and balls.  I\\u2019m thinking of getting a second one.  I\\u2019ve recommended the same to family and friends and they love it.  I highly recommend this product. I got this air pump and tried it out.I  was so impressed by it the instructions were easy to follow. I like that it came with these different things multiple uses.  I was so impressed I had to show off what it can do I lend to my friend and he was sold. Another friend asked me to bring it on vacation to fixed their tire because of how great this product is. The pressure gauge is accurateIt  also comes with a bag for carrying the unit which help to protect it from scratches and keepeverything together.  Overall, this isa good product and I like it.10  I recommend it. Easy to use.  Stops automatically at the pressure you set so it doesn\\u2019t need monitoring.  But the fully charged battery lasted less than 24 minutes.  In that time I was able to add 21 PSI to three tires.  If the battery lasted longer I would have given 5 stars.  It does come with a 10-foot 12V cord but I can\\u2019t reach all 4 tires with that length.  Overall, it\\u2019s a good product. I am so happy with this purchase! I had previously purchased a different portable air pump at a similar price point. My old pump was about 10 times the size, and did not have as many features. The compact size makes it ultra portable. I appreciate having the ability to select different modes so that the pump can be used safely on anything from sports equipment to vehicle tires. The handy built in flashlight is nice and bright, and the unit can be used as a power bank to recharge a cell phone in an emergency. My sister had a low tire on her vehicle when this arrived, so I had the opportunity to test out my new gadget right away, and it worked like a dream! I\'m looking forward to having this pump in the summer for pool toys and camping trips, and I plan to purchase a couple as gifts for upcoming birthdays. Unlike a hand pump, this requires zero effort to properly inflate bike tires, and the price was very reasonable. Seems to hold a charge for a long period of time, and seems to accurately inflate to the desired pressure. Really wonderful product! I mostly use this for my motorcycle and it\\u2019s pretty fast and small to put in my trunk, I will say it is a little slow pumping a car tire but that\\u2019s because they\\u2019re bigger tires meaning they need more airIt\\u2019s also accurate with the psi reading overall would buy again Nice little compressor.  Easy to program.  A better connector would be nice, since the one it has bleeds a lot of air pressure till you get the unit working.  But, the real problem is--it stops working at 33psi.  Tried to fill the front tire on my motorcycle to 36psi, but it gets to 33 and quits.  Tried it four (4) times and the same thing happened every time.  Aside from the air loss from the connector (probably can\'t expect a top-of-the-line one on a $40 unit) it wasn\'t badly designed unit.  I returned the unit I got, since as-is it\'s useless to me (tire pressure on motorcycles is a serious safety issue).  If the replacement unit works as advertised, I\'ll revise my rating accordingly.Update:I got the replacement unit in less than a week, long before I was notified that they received the defective unit.  I also got a locking tire chuck extension for $7 to try to compensate for the poor connector.  The new unit works like a charm.", "max_tokens": 150}' message='Post details'

Focus on the main points that would be most helpful for someone considering this product:\\nSuper compact, filled 4 automobile tires with charge left.  The pump fills quickly and the charge cord which attached to your vehicle has plenty of length.  Super happy!! This product comes in sharp packaging.  Has a nice bag the fits in the center console of my car for easy storage.  It charges quickly and can inflate all 4 of my cars tires ( from 36 psi to 42 psi in winter for my Tesla) on a single charge with room to spare.  I has already saved me many trips to the gas station tire pump in the free months I\\u2019ve owned it.  The battery recharges quickly.  You can also change the psi quickly and easily for bike tires and balls.  I\\u2019m thinking of getting a second one.  I\\u2019ve recommended the same to family and friends and they love it.  I highly recommend this product. I got this air pump and tried it out.I  was so impressed by it the instructions were easy to follow. I like that it came with these different things multiple uses.  I was so impressed I had to show off what it can do I lend to my friend and he was sold. Another friend asked me to bring it on vacation to fixed their tire because of how great this product is. The pressure gauge is accurateIt  also comes with a bag for carrying the unit which help to protect it from scratches and keepeverything together.  Overall, this isa good product and I like it.10  I recommend it. Easy to use.  Stops automatically at the pressure you set so it doesn\\u2019t need monitoring.  But the fully charged battery lasted less than 24 minutes.  In that time I was able to add 21 PSI to three tires.  If the battery lasted longer I would have given 5 stars.  It does come with a 10-foot 12V cord but I can\\u2019t reach all 4 tires with that length.  Overall, it\\u2019s a good product. I am so happy with this purchase! I had previously purchased a different portable air pump at a similar price point. My old pump was about 10 times the size, and did not have as many features. The compact size makes it ultra portable. I appreciate having the ability to select different modes so that the pump can be used safely on anything from sports equipment to vehicle tires. The handy built in flashlight is nice and bright, and the unit can be used as a power bank to recharge a cell phone in an emergency. My sister had a low tire on her vehicle when this arrived, so I had the opportunity to test out my new gadget right away, and it worked like a dream! I\'m looking forward to having this pump in the summer for pool toys and camping trips, and I plan to purchase a couple as gifts for upcoming birthdays. Unlike a hand pump, this requires zero effort to properly inflate bike tires, and the price was very reasonable. Seems to hold a charge for a long period of time, and seems to accurately inflate to the desired pressure. Really wonderful product!

It does come with a 10-foot 12V cord but I can\\u2019t reach all 4 tires with that length.  Overall, it\\u2019s a good product. I am so happy with this purchase! I had previously purchased a different portable air pump at a similar price point. My old pump was about 10 times the size, and did not have as many features. The compact size makes it ultra portable. I appreciate having the ability to select different modes so that the pump can be used safely on anything from sports equipment to vehicle tires.

My sister had a low tire on her vehicle when this arrived, so I had the opportunity to test out my new gadget right away, and it worked like a dream! I\'m looking forward to having this pump in the summer for pool toys and camping trips, and I plan to purchase a couple as gifts for upcoming birthdays. Unlike a hand pump, this requires zero effort to properly inflate bike tires, and the price was very reasonable. Seems to hold a charge for a long period of time, and seems to accurately inflate to the desired pressure. Really wonderful product! I mostly use this for my motorcycle and it\\u2019s pretty fast and small to put in my trunk, I will say it is a little slow pumping a car tire but that\\u2019s because they\\u2019re bigger tires meaning they need more airIt\\u2019s also accurate with the psi reading overall would buy again Nice little compressor.  Easy to program.  A better connector would be nice, since the one it has bleeds a lot of air pressure till you get the unit working.  But, the real problem is--it stops working at 33psi.

If the replacement unit works as advertised, I\'ll revise my rating accordingly.Update:I got the replacement unit in less than a week, long before I was notified that they received the defective unit.

Ensure the summary is accurate and reflects the overall sentiment of the reviews. Focus on the main points that would be most helpful for someone considering this product:\\nSuper compact, filled 4 automobile tires with charge left.  The pump fills quickly and the charge cord which attached to your vehicle has plenty of length.  Super happy!! This product comes in sharp packaging.  Has a nice bag the fits in the center console of my car for easy storage.  It charges quickly and can inflate all 4 of my cars tires ( from 36 psi to 42 psi in winter for my Tesla) on a single charge with room to spare.  I has already saved me many trips to the gas station tire pump in the free months I\\u2019ve owned it.  The battery recharges quickly.  You can also change the psi quickly and easily for bike tires and balls.  I\\u2019m thinking of getting a second one.  I\\u2019ve recommended the same to family and friends and they love it.  I highly recommend this product. I got this air pump and tried it out.I  was so impressed by it the instructions were easy to follow. I like that it came with these different things multiple uses.  I was so impressed I had to show off what it can do I lend to my friend and he was sold. Another friend asked me to bring it on vacation to fixed their tire because of how great this product is. The pressure gauge is accurateIt  also comes with a bag for carrying the unit which help to protect it from scratches and keepeverything together.  Overall, this isa good product and I like it.10  I recommend it. Easy to use.  Stops automatically at the pressure you set so it doesn\\u2019t need monitoring.  But the fully charged battery lasted less than 24 minutes.  In that time I was able to add 21 PSI to three tires.  If the battery lasted longer I would have given 5 stars.  It does come with a 10-foot 12V cord but I can\\u2019t reach all 4 tires with that length.  Overall, it\\u2019s a good product. I am so happy with this purchase! I had previously purchased a different portable air pump at a similar price point. My old pump was about 10 times the size, and did not have as many features. The compact size makes it ultra portable. I appreciate having the ability to select different modes so that the pump can be used safely on anything from sports equipment to vehicle tires. The handy built in flashlight is nice and bright, and the unit can be used as a power bank to recharge a cell phone in an emergency. My sister had a low tire on her vehicle when this arrived, so I had the opportunity to test out my new gadget right away, and it worked like a dream! I\'m looking forward to having this pump in the summer for pool toys and camping trips, and I plan to purchase a couple as gifts for upcoming birthdays. Unlike a hand pump, this requires zero effort to properly inflate bike tires, and the price was very reasonable. Seems to hold a charge for a long period of time, and seems to accurately inflate to the desired pressure. Really wonderful product! I mostly use this for my motorcycle and it\\u2019s pretty fast and small to put in my trunk, I will say it is a little slow pumping a car tire but that\\u2019s because they\\u2019re bigger tires meaning they need more airIt\\u2019s also accurate with the psi reading overall would buy again Nice little compressor.  Easy to program.  A better connector would be nice, since the one it has bleeds a lot of air pressure till you get the unit working.  But, the real problem is--it stops working at 33psi.  Tried to fill the front tire on my motorcycle to 36psi, but it gets to 33 and quits.  Tried it four (4) times and the same thing happened every time.  Aside from the air loss from the connector (probably can\'t expect a top-of-the-line one on a $40 unit) it wasn\'t badly designed unit.  I returned the unit I got, since as-is it\'s useless to me (tire pressure on motorcycles is a serious safety issue).  If the replacement unit works as advertised, I\'ll revise my rating accordingly.Update:I got the replacement unit in less than a week, long before I was notified that they received the defective unit.  I also got a locking tire chuck extension for $7 to try to compensate for the poor connector.  The new unit works like a charm.", "max_tokens": 150}' message='Post details'

Ensure the summary is accurate and reflects the overall sentiment of the reviews. Focus on the main points that would be most helpful for someone considering this product:\\nSuper compact, filled 4 automobile tires with charge left.  The pump fills quickly and the charge cord which attached to your vehicle has plenty of length.  Super happy!! This product comes in sharp packaging.  Has a nice bag the fits in the center console of my car for easy storage.  It charges quickly and can inflate all 4 of my cars tires ( from 36 psi to 42 psi in winter for my Tesla) on a single charge with room to spare.  I has already saved me many trips to the gas station tire pump in the free months I\\u2019ve owned it.  The battery recharges quickly.  You can also change the psi quickly and easily for bike tires and balls.  I\\u2019m thinking of getting a second one.  I\\u2019ve recommended the same to family and friends and they love it.  I highly recommend this product. I got this air pump and tried it out.I  was so impressed by it the instructions were easy to follow. I like that it came with these different things multiple uses.  I was so impressed I had to show off what it can do I lend to my friend and he was sold. Another friend asked me to bring it on vacation to fixed their tire because of how great this product is. The pressure gauge is accurateIt  also comes with a bag for carrying the unit which help to protect it from scratches and keepeverything together.  Overall, this isa good product and I like it.10  I recommend it. Easy to use.  Stops automatically at the pressure you set so it doesn\\u2019t need monitoring.  But the fully charged battery lasted less than 24 minutes.  In that time I was able to add 21 PSI to three tires.  If the battery lasted longer I would have given 5 stars.  It does come with a 10-foot 12V cord but I can\\u2019t reach all 4 tires with that length.  Overall, it\\u2019s a good product. I am so happy with this purchase! I had previously purchased a different portable air pump at a similar price point. My old pump was about 10 times the size, and did not have as many features. The compact size makes it ultra portable. I appreciate having the ability to select different modes so that the pump can be used safely on anything from sports equipment to vehicle tires. The handy built in flashlight is nice and bright, and the unit can be used as a power bank to recharge a cell phone in an emergency. My sister had a low tire on her vehicle when this arrived, so I had the opportunity to test out my new gadget right away, and it worked like a dream! I\'m looking forward to having this pump in the summer for pool toys and camping trips, and I plan to purchase a couple as gifts for upcoming birthdays. Unlike a hand pump, this requires zero effort to properly inflate bike tires, and the price was very reasonable. Seems to hold a charge for a long period of time, and seems to accurately inflate to the desired pressure. Really wonderful product! I mostly use this for my motorcycle and it\\u2019s pretty fast and small to put in my trunk, I will say it is a little slow pumping a car tire but that\\u2019s because they\\u2019re bigger tires meaning they need more airIt\\u2019s also accurate with the psi reading overall would buy again Nice little compressor.  Easy to program.  A better connector would be nice, since the one it has bleeds a lot of air pressure till you get the unit working.  But, the real problem is--it stops working at 33psi.  Tried to fill the front tire on my motorcycle to 36psi, but it gets to 33 and quits.  Tried it four (4) times and the same thing happened every time.  Aside from the air loss from the connector (probably can\'t expect a top-of-the-line one on a $40 unit) it wasn\'t badly designed unit.  I returned the unit I got, since as-is it\'s useless to me (tire pressure on motorcycles is a serious safety issue).  If the replacement unit works as advertised, I\'ll revise my rating accordingly.Update:I got the replacement unit in less than a week, long before I was notified that they received the defective unit.

Focus on the main points that would be most helpful for someone considering this product:\\nSuper compact, filled 4 automobile tires with charge left.  The pump fills quickly and the charge cord which attached to your vehicle has plenty of length.  Super happy!! This product comes in sharp packaging.  Has a nice bag the fits in the center console of my car for easy storage.  It charges quickly and can inflate all 4 of my cars tires ( from 36 psi to 42 psi in winter for my Tesla) on a single charge with room to spare.  I has already saved me many trips to the gas station tire pump in the free months I\\u2019ve owned it.  The battery recharges quickly.  You can also change the psi quickly and easily for bike tires and balls.  I\\u2019m thinking of getting a second one.  I\\u2019ve recommended the same to family and friends and they love it.  I highly recommend this product. I got this air pump and tried it out.I  was so impressed by it the instructions were easy to follow. I like that it came with these different things multiple uses.  I was so impressed I had to show off what it can do I lend to my friend and he was sold. Another friend asked me to bring it on vacation to fixed their tire because of how great this product is. The pressure gauge is accurateIt  also comes with a bag for carrying the unit which help to protect it from scratches and keepeverything together.  Overall, this isa good product and I like it.10  I recommend it. Easy to use.  Stops automatically at the pressure you set so it doesn\\u2019t need monitoring.  But the fully charged battery lasted less than 24 minutes.  In that time I was able to add 21 PSI to three tires.  If the battery lasted longer I would have given 5 stars.  It does come with a 10-foot 12V cord but I can\\u2019t reach all 4 tires with that length.  Overall, it\\u2019s a good product. I am so happy with this purchase! I had previously purchased a different portable air pump at a similar price point. My old pump was about 10 times the size, and did not have as many features. The compact size makes it ultra portable. I appreciate having the ability to select different modes so that the pump can be used safely on anything from sports equipment to vehicle tires. The handy built in flashlight is nice and bright, and the unit can be used as a power bank to recharge a cell phone in an emergency. My sister had a low tire on her vehicle when this arrived, so I had the opportunity to test out my new gadget right away, and it worked like a dream! I\'m looking forward to having this pump in the summer for pool toys and camping trips, and I plan to purchase a couple as gifts for upcoming birthdays. Unlike a hand pump, this requires zero effort to properly inflate bike tires, and the price was very reasonable. Seems to hold a charge for a long period of time, and seems to accurately inflate to the desired pressure. Really wonderful product! I mostly use this for my motorcycle and it\\u2019s pretty fast and small to put in my trunk, I will say it is a little slow pumping a car tire but that\\u2019s because they\\u2019re bigger tires meaning they need more airIt\\u2019s also accurate with the psi reading overall would buy again Nice little compressor.  Easy to program.  A better connector would be nice, since the one it has bleeds a lot of air pressure till you get the unit working.  But, the real problem is--it stops working at 33psi.  Tried to fill the front tire on my motorcycle to 36psi, but it gets to 33 and quits.  Tried it four (4) times and the same thing happened every time.  Aside from the air loss from the connector (probably can\'t expect a top-of-the-line one on a $40 unit) it wasn\'t badly designed unit.  I returned the unit I got, since as-is it\'s useless to me (tire pressure on motorcycles is a serious safety issue).  If the replacement unit works as advertised, I\'ll revise my rating accordingly.Update:I got the replacement unit in less than a week, long before I was notified that they received the defective unit.  I also got a locking tire chuck extension for $7 to try to compensate for the poor connector.  The new unit works like a charm.", "max_tokens": 150}' message='Post details'

Ensure the summary is accurate and reflects the overall sentiment of the reviews. Focus on the main points that would be most helpful for someone considering this product:\\nI absolutely love these New Balance steel toe shoes this is my second pair but a different design I like these even more than my first pair and I loved my first pair there lightweight they\'re comfortable they\'re durable and they\'re all around good pair of steek toe shoes for any man that\'s on their feet most of the day and works construction/office work The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nThe shoes are amazing.  I got these in the 13 4E size.  I love the roominess and how wide they are.  They also have a wide base and platform which I like.  They breathe well and are lightweight considering they\'re alloy toe.  Best and most important of all, they feel like actual tennis shoes and not work shoes.Now the bad.  The insoles are terrible! I\'m a bigger guy around 290 but I\'ve only been wearing these for two days and realized the insoles were no bueno.  As you can see from the photos the very thin foam insoles are already crushed in places allowing little to no rebound.  I\'ve only worn them for 2 8 hour work shifts.  I\'ve remedied this by replacing them with Dr. Scholls Extra Support insoles which seem to fit this shoe like a glove without trimming.  Now, they\'re like walking on air! I bought these as my running shoes fit, made by New Balance, is just right for my feet and they are very comfy for running or other sports. So I figured these should be good.They are very, very comfy to wear all day on a concrete plant floor, way more than I expected, so that is a plus.Lightweight, much lighter than the standard issue shoes or boots, which is also a plus.Soles are grippy, which is good.Seems to be mildly chemical resistant - hydraulic oil, coolant, minor chemicals.However, the issue for me is how the soft layer starts to tear away from the sole. I have found that the corners of the sole in the grooves to allow it to flex, have started to separate from the soft layer because the foam is tearing. Not good for longevity. I have currently tried to fix this with some dabs of E6000 adhesive and I will see how it holds up, but this is a concern for me. Everything else has endured daily wear, around manufacturing plants, through many airports and they still look good considering how much I wear them.Just this tearing, which is not through abuse, I am pretty careful, it is a design flaw where these corners can catch and drag on any edges on a floor.Overall I am very happy with them and will wear them until they fail. This is my second pair; great work shoe. Best i\'ve ever had as far as comfort, and last a long time Light and comfortable The product arrived via fast delivery (before 8 am next day). I wonder if Amazon knows that this product is likely to be needed for work and therefore offers extra fast delivery. The shoe fits great. The sole does not have any arch support but thankfully, it can be replaced easily with another insole. I bought the black and grey which looks very non-discrete and low maintenance. It\'s bulkier than a running shoe but not as much as a hiking shoe. The leather upper should hold up better than nylon uppers. NB has a reputation for making shoes that are good for your feet so that\'s another reason for going with this shoe.  I purchased another competing shoe but the fit and quality for NB was better. I expect to be walking around industrial environments in my profession so this shoe should serve me well for travel as well. And in regards to the shoe is really great it gets a three just because the aesthetic looks kinda like a Clown shoe however it feels good and seems to last a long time Part of what I do for a living is window washing, I have to climb ladders all day long, walk on roofs. These shoes are comfortable sturdy. And I can walk on pre-steep roofs without slipping. Plus they have a steel toe that protects me from injuries.I would highly recommend these shoes and I would purchase them again Comfortable shoe and great price Cumple con mis requerimientos Reliable and I used them for work I stand all", "max_tokens": 150}' message='Post details'

Ensure the summary is accurate and reflects the overall sentiment of the reviews. Focus on the main points that would be most helpful for someone considering this product:\\nI have relatively small ear canals, so I need to use the smallest silicone caps and most earbuds tend to fall out after a few minutes. These Amazon Basics buds fit very well and don\'t fall out, even using the medium-sized caps that come pre-fitted. Part of the good fit might be due to the shape of the driver portion of the earbud which fits snugly in the ear. While the sound may not be audiophile quality, it\'s good enough for my purposes - watching movies on long-haul flights, and listening to streaming audio on my phone. I can\'t speak to the mic or audio controls as I don\'t use these features. I wasn\'t expecting much given the price, but was pleasantly surprised. They are comfortable, block out a decent amount of noise, and most importantly sound great for their price point.My only potential concern is how long they will hold up as the wires seem pretty thin, but so far a month in I haven\'t had any issues. I buy these often because my dog gets ahold of them and destroy them in a second.  I am forgetful and leave myself open to allow my dog to find them.  They work well until crunch time.  What can I say?  They sound relatively good for watching YT videos where the sound source is not always reliably good.  They\'re adequate for my needs at a low price. I have a Bluetooth adapter that I needed a set of earbuds for - this does the job.Don\'t expect a lot of \'controls\' at this price point - there is a SINGLE button on the Left ear wire for picking up/hanging up a phone call is all.I do like that they included a few different sizes of \'cups\' for different ears.While not completely a result of these buds, I played some test tracks and they sounded decent enough however I did have to use nearly maximum volume to really enjoy them.Frankly I really can\'t see spending more for this sort of thing as these sound fine. These were cheap, so maybe if you need better tone and sound, perhaps move up to something a bit more expensive. I thought these reminded me of the days when certain airlines gave these away as you got on the plane, and yes, that makes me pretty old, because that concept far preceded the \\"covid era\\" and the bare bones approach to all commercial flying these days. The more you spend, both on seats on the airplane and your accessories, the better your experience;  will probably stash these for travel in case I forgot! Great sound quality. Sleek design and comes with multiple sized ear gels. I use them to fall asleep except if you are a side sleeper can be uncomfortable. The call quality is great. They hear me I hear them. Strong mic. Easy to use and inexpensive. Sounds come thru clearly These headphones work well for the price.  I enjoy the sound quality for music and conversations.  It\'s clear without distortion and people on the other end of the phone have no issues with hearing me as well.  They work well for sitting still or walking around.Their downfall is they let wind noise distort the sound if it\'s blowing, or I am riding my bike with them.  They don\'t work well for that at all.  The wind volume increases and sound volume decreases.The silicone earbuds covers fit fair, they are oblong the way they\'re mounted and don\'t really seal as well as if they were rounded.  For the price and for basic listening and calling they do well enough. These ear buds fit in my ear, but not very comfortably.  They are lightweight which is nice.  They easily worked with multiple devices without any issues.  The sound quality is average but effective.  The work which is what I need.  I\'d prefer to have something a bit more comfortable but at this price and the overall quality I\'m satisfied. I\\u2019m still using my old ones till they break or stop working ( cheap ones from the super market). But these seem to be well made and I\\u2019m confident they will be satisfactory. I bought them for my iPhone\\u2026IPhone doesn\\u2019t use headphones with wires\\u2026So I can\\u2019t say how the headphones work, but the user didn\\u2019t follow instructions.

Ensure the summary is accurate and reflects the overall sentiment of the reviews. Focus on the main points that would be most helpful for someone considering this product:\\nI have relatively small ear canals, so I need to use the smallest silicone caps and most earbuds tend to fall out after a few minutes. These Amazon Basics buds fit very well and don\'t fall out, even using the medium-sized caps that come pre-fitted. Part of the good fit might be due to the shape of the driver portion of the earbud which fits snugly in the ear. While the sound may not be audiophile quality, it\'s good enough for my purposes - watching movies on long-haul flights, and listening to streaming audio on my phone. I can\'t speak to the mic or audio controls as I don\'t use these features. I wasn\'t expecting much given the price, but was pleasantly surprised. They are comfortable, block out a decent amount of noise, and most importantly sound great for their price point.My only potential concern is how long they will hold up as the wires seem pretty thin, but so far a month in I haven\'t had any issues. I buy these often because my dog gets ahold of them and destroy them in a second.  I am forgetful and leave myself open to allow my dog to find them.  They work well until crunch time.  What can I say?  They sound relatively good for watching YT videos where the sound source is not always reliably good.  They\'re adequate for my needs at a low price. I have a Bluetooth adapter that I needed a set of earbuds for - this does the job.Don\'t expect a lot of \'controls\' at this price point - there is a SINGLE button on the Left ear wire for picking up/hanging up a phone call is all.I do like that they included a few different sizes of \'cups\' for different ears.While not completely a result of these buds, I played some test tracks and they sounded decent enough however I did have to use nearly maximum volume to really enjoy them.Frankly I really can\'t see spending more for this sort of thing as these sound fine. These were cheap, so maybe if you need better tone and sound, perhaps move up to something a bit more expensive. I thought these reminded me of the days when certain airlines gave these away as you got on the plane, and yes, that makes me pretty old, because that concept far preceded the \\"covid era\\" and the bare bones approach to all commercial flying these days. The more you spend, both on seats on the airplane and your accessories, the better your experience;  will probably stash these for travel in case I forgot! Great sound quality. Sleek design and comes with multiple sized ear gels. I use them to fall asleep except if you are a side sleeper can be uncomfortable. The call quality is great. They hear me I hear them. Strong mic. Easy to use and inexpensive. Sounds come thru clearly These headphones work well for the price.  I enjoy the sound quality for music and conversations.  It\'s clear without distortion and people on the other end of the phone have no issues with hearing me as well.  They work well for sitting still or walking around.Their downfall is they let wind noise distort the sound if it\'s blowing, or I am riding my bike with them.  They don\'t work well for that at all.  The wind volume increases and sound volume decreases.The silicone earbuds covers fit fair, they are oblong the way they\'re mounted and don\'t really seal as well as if they were rounded.  For the price and for basic listening and calling they do well enough. These ear buds fit in my ear, but not very comfortably.  They are lightweight which is nice.  They easily worked with multiple devices without any issues.  The sound quality is average but effective.  The work which is what I need.  I\'d prefer to have something a bit more comfortable but at this price and the overall quality I\'m satisfied. I\\u2019m still using my old ones till they break or stop working ( cheap ones from the super market). But these seem to be well made and I\\u2019m confident they will be satisfactory. I bought them for my iPhone\\u2026IPhone doesn\\u2019t use headphones with wires\\u2026So I can\\u2019t say how the headphones work, but the user didn\\u2019t follow instructions.

The consistency of the moisturizer was thick coming out of the tube and was very thick and heavy on the face. It was a bit difficult to spread and massage into to the skin. However it was extremely moisturizing to extra dry skin. In November 2023 I ran out and wanted to repurchase it. It wasn\\u2019t available in stock on Amazon or the products website. I had to wait until December 17 to be able to repurchase it. The moisturizer was not the same formula as the original moisturizer I bought in August. It seems they changed the formula. This formula is more watery coming out of the tube. It\\u2019s easier to spread but it\\u2019s not as heavy as the original formula. I also don\\u2019t find it as moisturizing as the original formula. It seems more as for a daytime moisturizer. I also noticed that it no longer states on the tube or the product description that it\\u2019s for extra dry skin. I actually could wear this new version of the moisturizer on a Texas summer day without worrying it would be to heavy. While the formula is not horrible and I will keep repurchasing it. It\\u2019s not as moisturizing as the original which made it an amazing nighttime cream. In the morning my skin doesn\\u2019t look or feel as hydrated, moisturized and plum as with the old formula. Im so disappointed this is not targeted anymore to extra dry skin. I also noticed that the smell isn\\u2019t the same as the original formula. I really wish they had kept the original formula that was for extra dry skin.Old review: My skin was very dry and was peeling. I wore this for 3 days and could already see a difference in my skin. My skin looks plump and even my pores looked smaller. My face felt hydrated and my skin texture is smooth. I wouldn\\u2019t wear it during the day because the heat and humidity in Texas is too much with this particular moisturizer. This moisturizer is thick and I apply it in sections at night. I\\u2019m definitely repurchasing it Good price for a wonderful product.  Quick shipping. Thick moisturizer that works well as an evening cream for dry skin I bought this because of the aging moisturizer that it says it is, I don\\u2019t see a difference between the regular one. But I do like it. This face cream is very moisterizing without feeling heavy or greasy. Love it! Wonderful product for super hydrated look and thick moisture- big bang for ur buck- and lasts forever - no smell - not comedogenic- definitely a must essential This moisturizer was disappointing. I felt like I wasted my money. It was very heavy and has an unpleasant smell. I was debating between this and the more famous Lait-Cr\\u00e8me Concentr\\u00e9, but went with this because I was looking more for a night cream, and so glad I did!The formula is very hydrating without being greasy. It can also be used during the day, which was a pleasant surprise. Makes my skin look amazing! Got the body cream version too, and am obsessed. Love everything French pharmacy I\'ve tried so far, and Embryolisse is quickly becoming a favorite. I  wanted to try this product because many make up artists swear by using this on their clients as a primer. It was not what I expected...it is extremely thick so it was very difficult to apply even after warming it between my palms. It is not the first moisturizer I go to so I haven\'t seen much of a change if any. I tell every older woman I know about this cr\\u00e8me .  Used on the neck daily it is a game changer, you will be impressed by the results. I found this in Paris in a pharmacy.  Loved it, but didn\'t know I could buy it in America.  Years later I had a professional photo shoot for business and the make up artist pulled this out of her bag and said it was a make up stylist everyday tool...it\'s a moisturizer and a primer.  I use the blue one for daytime under make up because it a lighter formula, and the red one for a nightime moisturizer.  Better than products 5x the cost. I have been struggling to find the best thing for my dry, aging skin. I wanted it to not only lo", "max_tokens": 150}' message='Post details'

Ensure the summary is accurate and reflects the overall sentiment of the reviews. Focus on the main points that would be most helpful for someone considering this product:\\nSuper compact, filled 4 automobile tires with charge left.  The pump fills quickly and the charge cord which attached to your vehicle has plenty of length.  Super happy!! This product comes in sharp packaging.  Has a nice bag the fits in the center console of my car for easy storage.  It charges quickly and can inflate all 4 of my cars tires ( from 36 psi to 42 psi in winter for my Tesla) on a single charge with room to spare.  I has already saved me many trips to the gas station tire pump in the free months I\\u2019ve owned it.  The battery recharges quickly.  You can also change the psi quickly and easily for bike tires and balls.  I\\u2019m thinking of getting a second one.  I\\u2019ve recommended the same to family and friends and they love it.  I highly recommend this product. I got this air pump and tried it out.I  was so impressed by it the instructions were easy to follow. I like that it came with these different things multiple uses.  I was so impressed I had to show off what it can do I lend to my friend and he was sold. Another friend asked me to bring it on vacation to fixed their tire because of how great this product is. The pressure gauge is accurateIt  also comes with a bag for carrying the unit which help to protect it from scratches and keepeverything together.  Overall, this isa good product and I like it.10  I recommend it. Easy to use.  Stops automatically at the pressure you set so it doesn\\u2019t need monitoring.  But the fully charged battery lasted less than 24 minutes.  In that time I was able to add 21 PSI to three tires.  If the battery lasted longer I would have given 5 stars.  It does come with a 10-foot 12V cord but I can\\u2019t reach all 4 tires with that length.  Overall, it\\u2019s a good product. I am so happy with this purchase! I had previously purchased a different portable air pump at a similar price point. My old pump was about 10 times the size, and did not have as many features. The compact size makes it ultra portable. I appreciate having the ability to select different modes so that the pump can be used safely on anything from sports equipment to vehicle tires. The handy built in flashlight is nice and bright, and the unit can be used as a power bank to recharge a cell phone in an emergency. My sister had a low tire on her vehicle when this arrived, so I had the opportunity to test out my new gadget right away, and it worked like a dream! I\'m looking forward to having this pump in the summer for pool toys and camping trips, and I plan to purchase a couple as gifts for upcoming birthdays. Unlike a hand pump, this requires zero effort to properly inflate bike tires, and the price was very reasonable. Seems to hold a charge for a long period of time, and seems to accurately inflate to the desired pressure. Really wonderful product! I mostly use this for my motorcycle and it\\u2019s pretty fast and small to put in my trunk, I will say it is a little slow pumping a car tire but that\\u2019s because they\\u2019re bigger tires meaning they need more airIt\\u2019s also accurate with the psi reading overall would buy again Nice little compressor.  Easy to program.  A better connector would be nice, since the one it has bleeds a lot of air pressure till you get the unit working.  But, the real problem is--it stops working at 33psi.  Tried to fill the front tire on my motorcycle to 36psi, but it gets to 33 and quits.  Tried it four (4) times and the same thing happened every time.  Aside from the air loss from the connector (probably can\'t expect a top-of-the-line one on a $40 unit) it wasn\'t badly designed unit.  I returned the unit I got, since as-is it\'s useless to me (tire pressure on motorcycles is a serious safety issue).  If the replacement unit works as advertised, I\'ll revise my rating accordingly.Update:I got the replacement unit in less than a week, long before I was notified that they received the defective unit.  I also got a locking tire chuck extension for $7 to try to compensate for the poor connector.  The new unit works like a charm.", "max_tokens": 150}' message='Post details'

The consistency of the moisturizer was thick coming out of the tube and was very thick and heavy on the face. It was a bit difficult to spread and massage into to the skin. However it was extremely moisturizing to extra dry skin. In November 2023 I ran out and wanted to repurchase it. It wasn\\u2019t available in stock on Amazon or the products website. I had to wait until December 17 to be able to repurchase it. The moisturizer was not the same formula as the original moisturizer I bought in August. It seems they changed the formula. This formula is more watery coming out of the tube. It\\u2019s easier to spread but it\\u2019s not as heavy as the original formula. I also don\\u2019t find it as moisturizing as the original formula. It seems more as for a daytime moisturizer. I also noticed that it no longer states on the tube or the product description that it\\u2019s for extra dry skin. I actually could wear this new version of the moisturizer on a Texas summer day without worrying it would be to heavy. While the formula is not horrible and I will keep repurchasing it. It\\u2019s not as moisturizing as the original which made it an amazing nighttime cream. In the morning my skin doesn\\u2019t look or feel as hydrated, moisturized and plum as with the old formula. Im so disappointed this is not targeted anymore to extra dry skin. I also noticed that the smell isn\\u2019t the same as the original formula. I really wish they had kept the original formula that was for extra dry skin.Old review: My skin was very dry and was peeling. I wore this for 3 days and could already see a difference in my skin. My skin looks plump and even my pores looked smaller. My face felt hydrated and my skin texture is smooth. I wouldn\\u2019t wear it during the day because the heat and humidity in Texas is too much with this particular moisturizer. This moisturizer is thick and I apply it in sections at night. I\\u2019m definitely repurchasing it Good price for a wonderful product.  Quick shipping. Thick moisturizer that works well as an evening cream for dry skin I bought this because of the aging moisturizer that it says it is, I don\\u2019t see a difference between the regular one. But I do like it. This face cream is very moisterizing without feeling heavy or greasy. Love it! Wonderful product for super hydrated look and thick moisture- big bang for ur buck- and lasts forever - no smell - not comedogenic- definitely a must essential This moisturizer was disappointing. I felt like I wasted my money. It was very heavy and has an unpleasant smell. I was debating between this and the more famous Lait-Cr\\u00e8me Concentr\\u00e9, but went with this because I was looking more for a night cream, and so glad I did!The formula is very hydrating without being greasy. It can also be used during the day, which was a pleasant surprise. Makes my skin look amazing! Got the body cream version too, and am obsessed. Love everything French pharmacy I\'ve tried so far, and Embryolisse is quickly becoming a favorite. I  wanted to try this product because many make up artists swear by using this on their clients as a primer. It was not what I expected...it is extremely thick so it was very difficult to apply even after warming it between my palms. It is not the first moisturizer I go to so I haven\'t seen much of a change if any. I tell every older woman I know about this cr\\u00e8me .  Used on the neck daily it is a game changer, you will be impressed by the results. I found this in Paris in a pharmacy.  Loved it, but didn\'t know I could buy it in America.  Years later I had a professional photo shoot for business and the make up artist pulled this out of her bag and said it was a make up stylist everyday tool...it\'s a moisturizer and a primer.  I use the blue one for daytime under make up because it a lighter formula, and the red one for a nightime moisturizer.  Better than products 5x the cost. I have been struggling to find the best thing for my dry, aging skin. I wanted it to not only lo", "max_tokens": 150}' message='Post details'

Thick moisturizer that works well as an evening cream for dry skin I bought this because of the aging moisturizer that it says it is, I don\\u2019t see a difference between the regular one. But I do like it. This face cream is very moisterizing without feeling heavy or greasy. Love it! Wonderful product for super hydrated look and thick moisture- big bang for ur buck- and lasts forever - no smell - not comedogenic- definitely a must essential This moisturizer was disappointing. I felt like I wasted my money. It was very heavy and has an unpleasant smell. I was debating between this and the more famous Lait-Cr\\u00e8me Concentr\\u00e9, but went with this because I was looking more for a night cream, and so glad I did!The formula is very hydrating without being greasy. It can also be used during the day, which was a pleasant surprise. Makes my skin look amazing! Got the body cream version too, and am obsessed.

I  wanted to try this product because many make up artists swear by using this on their clients as a primer. It was not what I expected...it is extremely thick so it was very difficult to apply even after warming it between my palms. It is not the first moisturizer I go to so I haven\'t seen much of a change if any. I tell every older woman I know about this cr\\u00e8me .  Used on the neck daily it is a game changer, you will be impressed by the results. I found this in Paris in a pharmacy.  Loved it, but didn\'t know I could buy it in America.  Years later I had a professional photo shoot for business and the make up artist pulled this out of her bag and said it was a make up stylist everyday tool...it\'s a moisturizer and a primer.  I use the blue one for daytime under make up because it a lighter formula, and the red one for a nightime moisturizer.  Better than products 5x the cost. I have been struggling to find the best thing for my dry, aging skin. I wanted it to not only lo", "max_tokens": 150}' message='Post details'
